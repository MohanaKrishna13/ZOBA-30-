# ZOBΛ‑30™ Prototype – Room-Temperature Quantum Neural Chip 🧠💡

This is a full working prototype of a photonic Quantum Neural Network with ethics enforcement and photon reuse, designed to function at room temperature.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ 30-qubit QNN using advanced gates (U3, CZ)
- ♻️ Photon reuse simulation (avg 9.5 cycles) via PCR loop
- 🔐 Ethics layer via circuit hash whitelisting
- 🧠 Media-ethics classification using QNN
- 📊 Final live benchmark summary
